# AI-Based-Driver-Drowsiness-Attention-Monitoring-System
Overview

This project presents a real-time AI-based Driver Drowsiness and Attention Monitoring System designed to detect fatigue levels and compute an adaptive driver attention score using computer vision techniques.

The system analyzes facial landmarks in real time, calculates eye aspect ratio (EAR), monitors blink rate and head orientation, and generates a dynamic risk score to trigger automated alerts.

The goal is to simulate a scalable AI-powered driver safety module that can be integrated into intelligent automotive systems and autonomous vehicle platforms.
